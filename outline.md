- Pre-requisites
  - OpenAI API
  - Typescript (Async, Await, basic syntax)
  - GPT Chat completion "Roles"
  - Training cutoff date
  - JSON Schema: https://bjdash.github.io/JSON-Schema-Builder/
    - Don't know JSON Schema? ChatGPT does.
- Demonstartion: Spam detection without functions.
- The problem
  - Bridging natural language and computer language.
  - _Cleanly_ interface software with LLM results.
  - Avoid string manipulation and hacks.
- The solution
  - New GPT "function_calls"
- What is it?
  - You give GPT a list of functions your application has.
  - GPT intelligently selects the correct function based on context.
- Real-world applications
  - Robotics (call robot function based on incoming data)
  - Text-based interfaces (run application feature based on English requests)
  - Giving GPT the ability to retrieve data after the training cutoff date.
- Caveats
  - Only works with some models: `gpt-4-0613`, `gpt-3.5-turbo-0613`
  - non-helpful 400 errors are common starting out.
- Looking forward
